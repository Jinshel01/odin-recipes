        <h2>The Best Sausage Stuffing</h2>
        <p>This stuffing has lots of flavor and is nice and moist. You can also change the ingredients to your liking. I quadruple this<br>
            recipe and make the extra in my electric roaster, that's how much everyone loves it. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Breakfast Sausage(1 pound)</li>
            <li>Chopped Onion(0.75 cup)</li>
            <li>Finely Diced Celery(1.5 cups)</li>
            <li>Melted Margarine(0.75 cup)</li>
            <li>White Bread Cubes(8 cups)</li>
            <li>Poultry Seasoning(3 tsp)</li>
            <li>Ground Black Pepper(0.25 tsp)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt margarine. Add enough to sausage drippings to make 1 cup.</li>
            <li>Saute; onions and celery in margarine/dripping mixture until onion is tender. DO NOT BROWN. Stir in about 1/3 bread cubes. Put <br>
                in big bowl and add remaining bread cubes, poultry seasoning, and pepper. Watch your hands, it's hot. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Stuff turkey. You can also omit the sausage, increase the bread cubes to 9 cups, and add a teaspoon or two of salt. You can also<br>
                add apples, giblets, oysters, etc. This recipe is very adaptable. When cooking extra in the oven, place the stuffing in a buttered<br>
                casserole dish, and place in a pan of hot water. Cover, and baste with turkey drippings occasionally. It comes out really good.</li>
        </ol>
