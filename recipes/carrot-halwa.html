        <p>A Carrot Halwa recipe with a detailed step-by-step guide</p>
        <p>Gonna share the traditional way of making a delicious gajar ka halwa without any shortcuts or tweaks</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Carrots(650g)</li>
            <li>Full-fat Milk(4 cups)</li>
            <li>Clarified Butter(4 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Sugar(10-12 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Cardamom Powder(0.5-1 tsp)</li>
            <li>Nuts and Dry fruits(of your choice)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First rinse, peel 650 grams carrots (8 to 9 medium-sized tender juicy carrots or 6 to 7 long carrots)</li>
            <li>Then grate the carrots either with a hand-held grater or in a food processor. You will<br>
                need about 4 to 4.5 cups grated carrots.</li>
            <li>In a heavy kadai, add all of the grated carrots.</li>
            <li>Pour 4 cups full-fat milk. Switch on the burner.</li>
            <li>Mix the grated carrots and milk together.</li>
            <li>Cook this mixture on a low to medium flame. After some minutes,the milk will begin<br>
                to froth first and then start reducing slowly and slowly.</li>
            <li>Keep on stirring this halwa mixture often. Keep scraping the sides of the kadai to remove the<br>
                evaporated milk solids. Add the milk solids to the cooking mixture. Simmer carrots in milk<br>
                and stir also at intervals, so that the milk does not stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Making</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the carrot and milk mixture until the milk is reduced by 75%.</li>
            <li>Then add 4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter). Do note that some milk will be there when<br>
                you add the ghee.</li>
            <li>Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Next add 10 to 12 tablespoons sugar or as required.</li>
            <li>Add about ½ to 1 teaspoon cardamom powder.</li>
            <li>Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Continue to simmer on a low flame. Do stir often.</li>
            <li>Simmer till the halwa mixture starts to thicken and reduces more. Stir at intervals.</li>
            <li>When the halwa has reduced much and you see a little milk – like that of a pudding consistency.Then add nuts<br>
                and dry fruits. You can add your choice of nuts and dry fruits. I have added 12 cashews, 12 almonds<br>
                and 2 tablespoons golden raisins.Chop the nuts before you add. Raisins can be kept whole.If using saffron, then<br>
                you can add at this step.</li>
            <li>Mix again and continue to stir and simmer.</li> 
            <li>Simmer till the whole halwa mixture becomes dry. The milk should evaporate completely and you will see fine<br>
                milk solids in the carrot halwa. You will also see some ghee being released from the sides. Remember to scrape<br>
                the milk solids stuck at the sides of the kadai or pan and add them to the gajar halwa. Some moisture is also<br>
                fine in the halwa.</li>
            <li>Serve gajar ka halwa hot or warm. Refrigerate the leftovers and while serving you can warm the halwa. Garnish with<br>
                some chopped dry fruits while serving.</li>       
        </ol>
